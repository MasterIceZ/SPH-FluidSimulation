# SPH Fluid Simulation

This repository contains source code for a simple lagrangian fluid simulation using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method. This work is also a final project for the course **Realtime Computer Graphics and Physics Simulation** at [Chulalongkorn University](https://chula.ac.th).

By implementing the SPH method, we can simulate fluid dynamics in a more realistic way. The simulation is based on the paper:

- [Particle-Based Fluid Simulation for Interactive Applications](https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/publications/sca03.pdf)

## Framework

- C++
- OpenGL
- GLFW

## Running the Code

Build and Run using Makefile:

```
make MAIN_FILE=src/main.cpp
```
